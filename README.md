# peer-to-peer-comms
This repo will cover peer to peer communications which cannot be censured


We want to make a Discord alternative which can't be censured. There are several ideas to expand on and explore:

We need to be able to do the following:

1) Text communications on a P2P level
2) P2P based file sharing (think images) within the text communicaitons
3) P2P based voice communications.

This can be done in any supporting language. It is recommended that we leverage Javascript due to webrtc. Javascript and NodeJS would be the appropriate primary languages for this operation then.
